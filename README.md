# ðŸ“„ PicoBlog ðŸ“„

PicoBlog is a *zero config* policy website blog-post application, where all you have to do is to point it to a directory and it will scan recursively for any *.md files at startup.
Those marked with `public: true` inside the header, will be made available.

*This is not a static generator*.

Build with **.NET MVC** - *because I'm too old for the other cool site generators.*

**A beautiful home with huge previews of the post**

**Posts with a beautiful photo gallery**

## Authentication

Its possible to lock down the site with a password that is set with the environment variable `PASSWORD=sUp3rS3cr34P4ss!`. If this variable is empty, then authorization is turned off. To persist login sessions between server restarts mount `/config` folder to the container at initialization.

## Environment variables

These are listed in [picoblog/Config.cs at main Â· jonasbg/picoblog Â· GitHub](https://github.com/jonasbg/picoblog/blob/main/Models/Config.cs)

| Variable name        | Default value | Description                                                                                                             |
| --------------------:|:-------------:| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CONFIG_DIR           | `/config`     | When using `PASSWORD` env variable, mount a `CONFIG_DIR` so that logins are persisted between container restarts.        |
| DATA_DIR             | `/data`       | This is the data path inside the container that Picoblog will traverse for markdown files.                               |
| DOMAIN               | `localhost`   | This is primarily to support the Open Graph Protocol and link previews of your site.                                      |
| PASSWORD             | `empty`       | Password protected site is off by default. Turn it on by inserting any value for this environment.                       |
| PICOBLOG_ENABLE_BACKUP | `false`      | Enables automatic daily backups of posts. Set to `true` to enable, `false` to disable.                                    |
| SYNOLOGY_SIZE        | `XL`          | Synology creates default optimized images of your photos. Available sizes are `SM`,`M`Â and `XL`.                           |
| SYNOLOGY_SUPPORT     | `false`       | Synology Support is turned off by default, and it will automatically fallback if `@eaDir`Â is not found.                   |
| TITLE     | `Picoblog`       | The title of your blog and RSS feed                   |
| DESCRIPTION     | `A simple zero fraction blogging platform`       | The description of your blog and RSS feed                   |

# Todos

Some important work remains

- [x] ~~Search for `.md` files at a given interval or events. (Background task initiated on site request within a given interval ie. once every 5min if theres traffic to the site)~~

- [x] ~~Better mobile responsive support~~

- [ ] Tags in posts. This is not implemented but will be `tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]`

- [x] ~~Image optimization where `SYNOLOGY_SUPPORT` is unavailable - *or Synology optimized imagere are **too** optimized for your taste*~~__Note: HEIC is not supported__

- [ ] Big Picture and carousel mode with basic `EXIF`support such as

  - [ ] Camera model

  - [ ] Lens model

  - [ ] Shutter speed

  - [ ] Aperture

  - [ ] ISO

  - [ ] Location on a mini map

  - [ ] Description

  - [ ] Tags

- [x] ~~Virtual directory with assets imported from `*.md` files as a security measurement.~~
